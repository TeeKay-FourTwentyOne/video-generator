# Neptune in Aries — Rewrite Brief

## Context
Rewriting the Neptune in Aries video from a dark/deadpan thriller into a fun, whimsical, comedic short. Same core fact (Neptune enters Aries Jan 26 2026, last time = 1861 = Civil War, 165-year cycle). New framing: Aries the Ram's perspective. Pixar-short energy.

## Concept
A cute cartoon ram (Aries) is vibing — life is good. Then they get the news: Neptune is moving into their sign. The ram Googles "last time Neptune was in Aries" and has a full panic meltdown when they discover the Civil War connection. Montage of increasingly dramatic historical imagery. The ram tries to cope. Lands on something funny.

## Tone
Whimsical, light, genuinely funny. The comedy comes from:
1. A cute kawaii ram having an existential crisis over planetary transits
2. The contrast between adorable character design and "oh no, civil war" energy
3. The absurdity of a cartoon animal taking astrology this seriously
4. The escalation from chill vibes to full panic and back

## Visual Style
- **Bookends (shots 1, 2, 5):** Kawaii / cute animation. Round soft ram character, pastel colors, big expressive eyes. Think Molang or Pusheen energy.
- **Montage (shots 3, 4):** Style shifts — could go dramatic/mixed media. Quick cuts of stylized historical imagery, newspaper headlines, maps, battle scenes — but filtered through a cartoon lens. Not realistic, more like a children's book illustration of history gone wrong.

## Duration
20-30 seconds. 9:16 vertical (Shorts/Reels).

## Shot Breakdown

### 1. VIBES (3-4s)
Kawaii ram sitting on a cloud or in a cozy pastel room. Stars twinkling. Maybe sipping tea or looking at their phone. Everything is peaceful. Soft music.

### 2. THE NOTIFICATION (3-4s)
Ram gets an alert / sees a headline / Neptune (as a character? a big blue blob?) appears at their door with suitcases. The ram's expression shifts — confusion, then concern. "Last time you were here..."

### 3. THE GOOGLE (4-6s)
Quick montage: the ram frantically searching. Screen shows "Neptune in Aries 1861." Style shift — dramatic zoom, record scratch energy. Flash cuts of stylized Civil War imagery: cannons, flags, maps splitting in half, a calendar showing "1861" with fire around it. Each image more dramatic than the last. The music goes from cute to ominous (comedically so).

### 4. THE MELTDOWN (3-4s)
Ram in full panic mode. Classic cartoon panic — spinning in circles, eyes bugging out, maybe hiding under a blanket. Quick cuts between the ram freaking out and historical chaos imagery.

### 5. THE LANDING (4-6s)
The ram collects themselves. Deep breath. Looks at camera. Either:
- **Option A:** "This is fine" energy — sips tea while everything is on fire behind them
- **Option B:** Puts on a tiny helmet, holds up a tiny shield. Ready for whatever.
- **Option C:** Checks phone again — "Neptune leaves Aries: 2039." Faints.

Text card: **NEPTUNE ENTERS ARIES / JANUARY 26, 2026**

## Audio
- Cute/bouncy music for bookends (think Animal Crossing or lo-fi kawaii)
- Comedic dramatic sting for the reveal (dun dun DUNNN)
- Quick SFX: notification ping, record scratch, cartoon panic sounds
- Optional: short VO or text-on-screen for key beats

## Production Approach
1. Save v2 brief to `briefs/neptune-aries.md` (original v1 only existed in workspace, now archived)
2. Write Veo prompts for each shot — output for review, do NOT submit to APIs
3. Iterate on prompts together before generating anything
4. Character locking on the ram design for consistency
5. The montage shots can be more varied/experimental since the style shift is intentional
6. Assembly with music + SFX layers after clips are approved

## Notes
- The ram should be CUTE. Merchandisably cute. The cuter the ram, the funnier the panic.
- Neptune as a character (if used) should feel ominous but goofy — big, blue, slightly clueless about the chaos they cause
- No real violence or darkness — the Civil War references should be cartoonish (cannons going "poof", maps with a cartoon crack down the middle)
- The whole thing should make someone smile on first watch and share on second
