## The Story

A comedian is bombing on a vaudeville stage. He's deep into a routine that isn't working — sweating, mugging, desperate. He tells one more joke. It's a real joke, a solid joke even, but the audience gives him nothing. Silence. A cough. A glass clink.

He doesn't walk offstage. He turns his back to the audience, faces the red velvet curtain behind him, and tears it open. There's a hole behind it — a tunnel — that shouldn't exist. He crawls through.

The camera follows.

The tunnel begins as red velvet — folds of curtain fabric on all sides, warm and close. But the material decays. Velvet thins to burlap, burlap to gauze, gauze to something wet and translucent. A membrane stretches across the passage, backlit cold blue. He pushes through it.

Now he's in backstage rigging — ropes, sandbags, pulleys. Recognizable theater infrastructure. But it goes on too long, gets too dense, and metal starts creeping in. Gears bolted to wooden beams. Rope threaded through pipe fittings. The backstage becomes a machine — iron pipes, brass gears turning, oil on every surface. At the end of the mechanical corridor, a perfect white circle of light.

He reaches it and the world breaks apart. An eye blinks. Water rushes. An empty fluorescent hallway flickers. Television static fills the frame. Then the static organizes itself back into red — the weave of velvet, seen from behind, light leaking through. Laughter bleeds in from the other side.

He pushes through the curtain and tumbles onto a stage. It looks almost identical to the one he left — same layout, same microphone, same spotlight. But the light is warmer. Golden instead of harsh white. And the audience is laughing. They were already laughing before he arrived. He hasn't said a word. The laughter builds into a standing ovation. He stands at the microphone, mouth open, saying nothing, and they love him for it.

His expression never resolves. It hangs somewhere between relief and fear. He doesn't move. The ovation holds.

Cut to black.

## Structure

### INTRO — The Banner
A hand-painted theatrical canvas banner fills the frame: **"HELLZAPOPPIN' LIVE! at The Barber's Chair"** in bold vaudeville lettering, red and gold on navy blue. The paint is cracked and worn — a touring show banner that's been rolled and unrolled a hundred times. It rises upward like a theater curtain, revealing the stage.

### ACT I — The Bomb (~10 seconds)
The comedian is already mid-routine when we find him. Wrinkled brown suit, harsh white spotlight, forced grin. He delivers the joke:

> *"So I told my barber — I said, make me look like a movie star. He said, which one? I said, surprise me! Well... I looked in the mirror... and boy was I surprised!"*

Big gesture. Huge grin. Holds for the laugh. The laugh does not come. His grin freezes, tightens, dies. He swallows. Looks around. Opens his mouth to try again. Closes it. He lets go of the microphone and turns upstage. He faces the curtain. His hand comes up and grabs the fabric. He tears it open.

**Production note:** Veo consistently refuses to have the audience not laugh — it generates supportive crowds. The boos, silence, and uncomfortable crowd ambience need to be generated separately and laid in during the edit. Veo believes in this man.

### ACT II — The Escape (~3 seconds)
He climbs into the ragged circular hole he's torn in the curtain. Legs kick, he disappears inside. The camera holds on the empty stage — spotlight on bare floorboards, torn curtain swaying, then settling. Then the camera pushes forward and enters the tunnel.

### ACT III — The Tunnel (~18 seconds)
The heart of the piece. Five phases, each its own visual world:

**Phase 1: Textile Decay**
POV crawling through red velvet folds. The fabric thins and roughens — velvet to burlap to gauze. Color drains from crimson to brown to grey. The walls grow damp. Threads hang down. We arrive at a taut wet membrane stretched across the passage, backlit cold blue, dark shapes silhouetted behind it. Hands press against it. It stretches but doesn't break.

**Phase 2: Backstage Rigging**
Hands push through the membrane — it tears with a wet snap. We're in a corridor of theatrical infrastructure. Ropes, sandbags, pulleys, a bare bulb on a frayed wire. Familiar backstage territory. But it gets denser, more tangled. The corridor narrows.

**Phase 3: The Machine**
Metal creeps into wood. Gears bolt onto beams. The backstage becomes industrial — iron pipes, brass gears turning slowly, oil on metal grating underfoot. A heavy chain hangs from the ceiling. The corridor terminates in a bright white circular opening, perfectly round, clean-edged against the grime. Pure overexposed light with no visible source. We crawl toward it. White fills the frame.

**Phase 4: Abstractions**
Hard cuts, each lasting one to two seconds. An extreme close-up of a human eye — it blinks, dissolves into rushing white water. A long empty fluorescent hallway, one tube flickering. Full-frame analog television static.

**Phase 5: Return to Curtain**
The static organizes into color — red. The tight weave of velvet in extreme close-up, backlit warm. Camera pulls back to reveal a red curtain seen from behind. Laughter bleeds through the fabric.

**Audio arc across the tunnel:** Muffled warmth and a slow heartbeat in the velvet. Wet, biological sounds through the gauze and membrane. Creaking ropes and mechanical clicking in the backstage. Grinding gears and hissing steam in the machine. Sharp isolated tones in the abstractions. Then the laughter, muffled at first, growing clearer.

### ACT IV — The Other Side (~12 seconds)
He pushes through the curtain and tumbles onto a stage that is almost identical to the one he left. Same red curtain, same microphone, same spotlight — but warmer. Golden. The curtain falls closed behind him, seamless, no hole. The audience is already laughing. Already in hysterics. He hasn't spoken. He stumbles to the microphone, bewildered. He opens his mouth. The laughter doubles. Standing ovation. Cheering. He stands in the warm spotlight, mouth slightly open, silent, expression caught between relief and fear, and the ovation does not stop.

Hold on his face. Cut to black. Applause continues one beat, then drops to silence.

### OUTRO — The Credits Banner
A second hand-painted canvas banner rolls down from the top of frame over black:

Same navy blue, cream white hand-lettering, cracked paint, 1930s sign painter style. It holds for a beat. Then a vaudeville shepherd's hook slides in from the right side of frame, hooks the banner, and yanks it offstage. The canvas crumples and drags away. Behind it: black. The hook retracts. Nothing.

## The Joke

The joke is real. It works. The punchline is that the punchline is just the setup restated — "surprise me / boy was I surprised" — which makes it both genuinely funny and structurally empty, a joke that folds in on itself. He's not a bad comedian. He's on the wrong stage. The same material, the same man, one side of the curtain gives him nothing and the other side gives him everything before he can open his mouth. Neither response has anything to do with him.

## Thematic Notes

"The Potted Palm" (No. 1) was about chaos invading a performance — the singer trying to hold her moment while the world disrupted her. She endured.

"The Barber's Chair" (No. 2) is the inverse — the performer invades reality. He doesn't endure the disruption, he escapes through it. But what he finds on the other side isn't freedom. It's a different kind of trap. An audience that loves him for nothing is not better than an audience that gives him nothing. Both ignore who he actually is.

The tunnel is the passage between two lies.
