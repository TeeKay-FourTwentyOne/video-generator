# Neptune in Aries — Production Brief (v3)

## Concept
A cute kawaii ram (Aries) is vibing — life is good. Then Neptune shows up at the door with suitcases. They're moving in. For the next 13 years. The ram is thrilled (Aries loves new energy). Neptune is... not ready. Montage of their wildly incompatible lifestyles. Neptune tries to cope. Odd-couple roommate comedy.

**Core fact:** Neptune enters Aries January 26, 2026. Stays until 2039. Neptune has been in dreamy, watery Pisces for 14 years. Now it's moving into a fire sign. Culture shock.

## Tone
Whimsical, light, genuinely funny. Pixar-short energy. The comedy comes from:
1. Neptune (dreamy, floaty, water energy) being completely overwhelmed by Aries (intense, fast, fire energy)
2. The ram being aggressively welcoming and supportive — which makes it worse
3. Fish-out-of-water comedy (literally: water planet, fire sign)
4. The escalation from "this will be fine" to "what have I done" to reluctant acceptance

## Visual Style
- **Bookends (shots 1, 2, 5):** Kawaii / cute animation. Round soft ram character, pastel colors, big expressive eyes. Think Molang or Pusheen energy.
- **Neptune character:** Soft, blobby, blue-green, translucent. Flowy and slow. Maybe trailing little fish or bubbles. Looks perpetually sleepy or dreamy.
- **Montage (shots 3, 4):** Quick cuts contrasting their energies. Ram's world is warm oranges and reds, kinetic motion. Neptune keeps trying to bring soft blues and slow vibes. Visual clash.

## Format
- Duration: 20-30 seconds
- Aspect ratio: 9:16 vertical (Shorts/Reels)

## Shot Breakdown

### Shot 1: VIBES (4s)
Kawaii ram sitting on a cloud or in a cozy pastel room. Stars twinkling. Maybe doing some light stretching or looking at a vision board. Everything is peaceful but energetic — the ram is content, not sleepy.
- **Mood:** peaceful, whimsical
- **Energy:** 0.3 | **Tension:** 0.1

### Shot 2: THE ARRIVAL (4s)
Doorbell or knock. Ram opens door. Neptune is standing there — big, soft, blue, holding suitcases, maybe trailing a few sad fish. Neptune looks exhausted from the move. Ram's expression: delighted, welcoming, maybe a little too enthusiastic. Neptune's expression: "oh no."
- **Mood:** whimsical → apprehensive (for Neptune)
- **Energy:** 0.5 | **Tension:** 0.3

### Shot 3: THE MISMATCH (6s)
Quick montage of incompatibility:
- Ram doing intense exercise / Neptune trying to meditate but getting jostled
- Ram's alarm going off at 5am / Neptune covering ears with pillow
- Ram making a protein shake / Neptune holding a delicate teacup, vibrating from the blender
- Ram enthusiastically showing Neptune a vision board labeled "GOALS" / Neptune's eyes glazing over
- Everything in the apartment slowly turning orange and red / Neptune looking at their sad little blue corner getting smaller

Each beat quick, punchy, comedic contrast.
- **Mood:** chaotic, comedic
- **Energy:** 0.8 | **Tension:** 0.6

### Shot 4: NEPTUNE'S LIMIT (4s)
Neptune hiding in the bathroom or closet. Soft blue glow. A moment of peace. Then: RAM BURSTS IN with a smoothie or a headband as a gift. Neptune's thousand-yard stare.
- **Mood:** chaotic → defeated
- **Energy:** 0.7 | **Tension:** 0.7

### Shot 5: THE LANDING (6s)
Neptune sits on the couch, resigned. Ram is doing pushups nearby or shadowboxing. Neptune sips tea. Looks at camera. Small shrug or weak smile. "This is my life now."

Maybe: Neptune starts to slightly, almost imperceptibly, bob along to the Ram's workout music. Tiny moment of adaptation.

End card: **NEPTUNE IN ARIES / 2026–2039**
- **Mood:** whimsical, bittersweet, hopeful
- **Energy:** 0.4 | **Tension:** 0.2

## Audio Plan
- Cute/bouncy music for bookends (Animal Crossing / lo-fi kawaii)
- Energy shift to more intense/upbeat during montage (but still playful)
- Quick SFX: doorbell, blender, alarm, cartoon movement sounds
- Text-on-screen for key beats (no VO needed, or optional VO if it helps)

## Character Notes
- **The ram** should be CUTE and ENTHUSIASTIC. Not aggressive — just intense in a golden retriever way. Genuinely wants Neptune to thrive. Doesn't understand why Neptune isn't thriving.
- **Neptune** should be soft, dreamy, slow-moving. Not grumpy — just overwhelmed. A introvert who just moved in with an extrovert. Sympathetic.
- The comedy is mutual incomprehension, not conflict. They're both trying. It's just a lot.

## Production Approach
1. Lock Neptune and Ram character designs for visual consistency
2. Montage shots (3, 4) can be quicker cuts, more experimental
3. Color palette shift: Pisces = blues/teals/soft → Aries = oranges/reds/warm
4. Write and review Veo prompts before generating
5. Assembly with music + SFX layers after clips are approved
