# JANUS / RUSSIAN ARK — Production Document

**Project:** a][ productions  
**Format:** 9:16 vertical  
**Target Duration:** ~30-35 seconds  
**Generations:** 3 (Veo 3 Flow, 8 sec each)  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## CONCEPT

Closing out January 2026 through the lens of Janus, god of thresholds, beginnings and endings, passages. Visual marriage with the final moments of Sokurov's *Russian Ark*—the museum-ark of European culture sailing into eternity/oblivion. Both figures look two directions at once. Both exist at the threshold.

**Three scales:** intimate → threshold → infinite

## VOICEOVER

Source: Final lines from *Russian Ark* (fresh VO generation, not lifted audio)

**Voice direction:** Gravity without pretension. Someone speaking from outside time. Not aristocratic whisper—more weary, tender, resigned to eternity.

**Full text:**

> "It's a pity you're not here with me  
> You would understand everything  
>   
> Look  
>   
> The sea is all around  
> We are destined to sail forever  
> To live forever"

## SHOT BREAKDOWN

### GENERATION 1 — THE COIN

**Duration:** 8 seconds  
**Scale:** Intimate / tactile

**Visual:**  
Close-up of a hand holding an ancient Janus coin. Two faces visible—one looking forward, one back. The coin is worn, weathered. Slow movement: examining it, turning it slightly, or perhaps offering it to someone unseen. Warm, low light. Shallow depth of field.

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Close-up of weathered hands holding an ancient Roman Janus coin, two-faced god visible on the surface. Slow, contemplative movement examining the coin. Warm amber lighting, shallow depth of field, intimate framing. 9:16 vertical format. Cinematic, meditative pace.
```

**VO Timing:**
- "It's a pity you're not here with me..."

### GENERATION 2 — THE THRESHOLD TO SEA

**Duration:** 8 seconds  
**Scale:** Architectural / liminal

**Visual:**  
A Janus figure (stone statue, two-faced, weathered) stands within an ornate doorway or archway. Through the doorway—impossibly—open sea stretches to the horizon. No land, no room beyond. The palace opens directly onto water. Camera static or very slow push toward the threshold.

This is the synthesis shot: Janus guards the passage, and the passage leads only to the eternal voyage.

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Ancient two-faced Janus statue standing in an ornate baroque doorway. Through the doorway, endless calm sea stretches to the horizon—the palace opens impossibly onto water. Diffused golden light. Camera slowly pushes toward the threshold. Dreamlike, liminal atmosphere. 9:16 vertical format.
```

**VO Timing:**
- "You would understand everything..."
- "Look..."

### GENERATION 3 — THE SEA ETERNAL

**Duration:** 8 seconds  
**Scale:** Infinite / cosmic

**Visual:**  
We have passed through. Now only the sea—endless, grey-blue, stretching in all directions. Perhaps from the perspective of someone on a vessel (subtle movement), or floating, or simply the water itself. Horizon line. Mist or haze in the distance. The destination that is no destination.

**Veo Prompt:**
```
Endless calm sea stretching to misty horizon, seen from a drifting vessel or floating perspective. Gentle movement on the water. Overcast silvery light, atmospheric haze. Meditative, eternal quality. No land visible. 9:16 vertical format.
```

**VO Timing:**
- "The sea is all around..."
- "We are destined to sail forever..."
- "To live forever."

## POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

**Runtime extension options:**
- Gen 2 (threshold shot) is the best candidate for reverse-loop if needed—static architectural framing hides seams
- Gen 3 can hold longer with slow fade to black on final line

**Audio:**
- VO generated via ElevenLabs
- Minimal sound design: water ambience, perhaps distant resonance
- No music, or only the faintest drone—let the voice carry it

**Pacing:**
- Allow breath between VO lines
- "Look" should land as we see/approach the threshold
- Final line can extend into silence over the sea

---

## THEMATIC NOTES

Janus looks backward and forward. Russian Ark ends with Europe's cultural memory floating into an uncertain future—or an eternal present. January closes; we stand at the threshold of what comes next.

The coin is the talisman. The doorway is the passage. The sea is what remains.
