# Russian Ark Ending — Video Brief

## Reference

The final sequence of Alexander Sokurov's *Russian Ark* (2002). After a grand ball in the Hermitage, hundreds of nobles descend the Jordan Staircase toward the exit. Sokurov described what awaited them outside as "annihilation" — the Russian Revolution, the end of their world. The film ends as they step through the door into grey nothingness.

We're making an echo of this. Not a recreation.

## Concept

A procession of archetypes from the pre-AI world descends a grand staircase. They're dressed for celebration — awards shows, premieres, galas. They don't know they're walking toward the end of their era. The visual instability of AI generation becomes the point: they're already becoming ghosts, shimmering and drifting as they descend toward whatever comes next.

## Tone

Elegiac, not mocking. This isn't satire. It's a funeral procession that doesn't know it's a funeral.

## Format

- **Aspect ratio:** 9:16 vertical
- **Duration:** 30-45 seconds
- **Audio:** Something orchestral and fading, or silence with ambient murmur. No dialogue.

## Visual Approach

**Lean into artifacts.** Faces that drift, forms that shimmer, identities that blur — this serves the concept. These people are dissolving. Don't fight the instability.

**Archetypes, not likenesses.** We're not depicting specific celebrities. We're depicting types:
- The aging movie star in a tuxedo
- The influencer in something shimmering
- The producer with slicked hair
- The pop star with dramatic makeup
- The film critic in black
- The tech founder in a hoodie among the gowns (slightly out of place)

They should read as "the old world" without requiring recognizable faces.

**Descent.** The staircase is the spine. Vertical format makes this natural — the eye follows the procession down the frame. Grand architecture if possible, but the movement matters more than the setting.

**The ending.** They reach the bottom and step through a door or archway into light (white) or void (black). We don't see what's on the other side. Cut or fade before we know.

## Possible Structures

**Single shot (ideal if achievable):**
Slow descent, camera either static watching them pass or gently moving with/against the flow. One continuous take. The Russian Ark connection is partly about the unbroken gaze.

**Minimal cuts (fallback):**
2-3 shots. Wide on the staircase. Closer on faces as they pass. Final shot: the door, the light, they step through.

**Layered/composite (embrace the chaos):**
Multiple generations of the same descent, slightly offset, ghosts walking through ghosts. More experimental, more artifact-heavy. Could be striking or could be a mess.

## What Success Looks Like

Someone watches this for 30 seconds and feels something end. Not AI discourse. Just: an era passing, faces we'll never see again, a door closing.

## Notes for Implementation

- Don't worry about perfect consistency. The inconsistency is the texture.
- If Veo gives you something beautiful and unstable, use it.
- Black and white might help unify the image and lean into the elegiac tone. Or muted color, desaturated. Experiment.
- The staircase doesn't need to be the Hermitage. Any grand descent works. The feeling matters more than the reference.
- If you can't get a long continuous shot, cut on movement — bodies passing through frame create natural edit points.
