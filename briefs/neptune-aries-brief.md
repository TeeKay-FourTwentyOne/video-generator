# Neptune in Aries

## Concept
Two astronomers in a mountaintop observatory. One mentions Neptune's movement into Aries. The other connects it to the Civil War — the last time this happened. They laugh. Then they don't. Paranoia sets in over something trivial (a donut, the last coffee, whatever). Cut to black before violence.

## Tone
Deadpan absurdist. The humor comes from rational people (scientists, not astrologers) taking astrological determinism seriously despite themselves. Think early Coen Brothers — *Blood Simple* tension over a *Fargo* premise.

## Visual Style
- Warm interior lighting against dark windows showing night sky / mountain silhouette
- Observatory setting: monitors, maybe a telescope housing visible, coffee cups, clutter
- TV mounted on wall showing generic news scroll (indistinct, just "news vibes")
- Two characters clearly distinguished: **blue sweater** and **red turtleneck**

The blue/red coding is quiet but present — Civil War uniforms, modern political tribalism, whatever the viewer brings to it.

## Duration
20-30 seconds. Optimized for 9:16 vertical (Shorts/Reels).

## Shot Breakdown

### 1. ESTABLISHMENT
The observatory. Two colleagues. Comfortable, collegial atmosphere. One of them makes the Neptune observation. Could be looking at a monitor, could be casual conversation.

### 2. THE CONNECTION
The other one makes the Civil War link. They both laugh — maybe a little too hard. The kind of laugh where you're acknowledging something uncomfortable by pretending it's purely funny.

### 3. THE TURN
Laughter dies. A beat of silence. Maybe a glance at the TV (news scroll continuing, oblivious). The mood shifts. They're thinking about it now.

### 4. THE OBJECT
Something trivial enters the equation — a donut on a plate, the last slice of pizza, whatever. We see them both clock it. Close-ups on eyes. Stylized editing here: quick cuts, maybe some push-ins.

### 5. BLACK
One or both begins to move. Cut to black before we see the outcome.

## Notes

- No dialogue audio needed — this could work silent with music/ambient, or with VO, or with actual dialogue. Flexible.
- The TV news scroll should be illegible/generic. We want the *impression* of news, not actual content.
- The escalation from collegial to predatory should feel sudden but earned. The joke is how fast civilization evaporates.
- **No coda text.** The cut to black is the punchline. If anything, a cold open title card: "NEPTUNE ENTERS ARIES / JANUARY 26, 2026" — but even that's optional.

## Reference
Neptune entered Aries on January 26, 2026. Previous transit: 1861-1874 (Civil War began two days after Neptune entered Aries in April 1861). 165-year orbital period.
