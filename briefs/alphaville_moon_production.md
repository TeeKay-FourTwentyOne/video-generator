# ALPHAVILLE × MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

## a][ productions

### Title
Proceed.

### Format
9:16 vertical | ~25-30 seconds | VO-first edit

### Concept
A man makes a phone call in a cold, surveilled world. Every line of dialogue works simultaneously as espionage and creative collaboration. The visuals never leave the paranoid frame. The words do. The architecture argues for one reading. The face argues for another. The architecture gradually loses.

### Voice
- HIM: TBD
- VOICE: TBD. Crude TTS or processed human voice. Must sound like a machine. The humanity is in the words, not the delivery.

## NANO BANANA REFERENCE IMAGES

Generate all in 9:16 vertical.

### TRANSIT A — Opening
A lone man in a dark overcoat walks down a long brutalist concrete corridor, shot from behind at a distance. High contrast black and white cinematography. Fluorescent overhead lighting casts hard geometric shadows. 1960s French noir. 9:16 vertical frame. The corridor stretches ahead, featureless and institutional. Surveillance camera perspective, slightly elevated.

### TRANSIT B — Through Glass
A man in a dark overcoat seen through a pane of interior glass, slightly distorted. He is in a corridor or stairwell. High contrast black and white. 1960s French science fiction. The camera is positioned as though observing from a room he doesn't know about. 9:16 vertical frame.

### TRANSIT C — Losing Him
A brutalist corridor or stairwell, slightly out of focus. A man in a dark overcoat is at the edge of the frame, partially cut off, as though the camera turned too late to catch him. High contrast black and white. 1960s French noir. 9:16 vertical frame. The architecture dominates. The subject is escaping it.

### TRANSIT D — Walking Toward
A man in a dark overcoat walks toward the camera down a corridor. Not away — toward. High contrast black and white. 1960s French science fiction. 9:16 vertical frame. The lighting is slightly warmer or softer than previous shots. The geometry of the corridor frames him centrally. He is not hiding.

### THE CALL — Tense
Extreme close-up of a man's face holding a rotary telephone handset to his ear. High contrast black and white. Half the face illuminated by a single harsh light source from the left, the other half in deep shadow. 1960s French science fiction. His expression is tense, guarded. 9:16 vertical frame. Tight crop, forehead to chin.

### THE CALL — Shifting
Same composition. A man holds a rotary telephone to his ear. High contrast black and white. 1960s French noir. But his expression has softened slightly. His free hand is raised near his chest, mid-gesture, as though explaining something. 9:16 vertical frame. Tight crop.

### THE BREAK
Same man, same phone, same framing. But his eyes look directly into the camera. The faintest beginning of a smile. High contrast black and white. 1960s French noir. 9:16 vertical frame. Something has changed.

## CUT LIST

### CONTACT (0–10s)
Cuts are fast. Clipped. The world is in control.

| # | Line | Who | Shot | Notes |
|---|------|-----|------|-------|
| 1 | "I'm here." | HIM | TRANSIT A | Open on his back. Moving through the corridor. Voice already on the line. No phone visible. He's a figure inside a system. |
| 2 | "Proceed." | VOICE | THE CALL — Tense | Hard cut to extreme close-up. Phone at ear. The jump from distant to intimate is violent — the camera found him. |
| 3 | "The structure isn't holding. I need to start over." | HIM | THE CALL — Tense | Hold the same framing. A report or a revision. We don't know. |
| 4 | "Persist your current results before clearing." | VOICE | THE CALL — Tense (alt generation) | Same framing, different Veo generation. Slightly different lighting or angle. The world shifted. Subtle instability. |

### THE SLIP (10–20s)
Cuts slow slightly. The words start leaving the genre. The architecture doesn't notice.

| # | Line | Who | Shot | Notes |
|---|------|-----|------|-------|
| 5 | "What if we come at it from his perspective instead." | HIM | THE CALL — Tense | Same face, same framing. But this is the first line that sounds like a creative thought. The image hasn't caught up. |
| 6 | "His?" | VOICE | TRANSIT B — Through Glass | One word over an image of him seen through glass. Who is watching whom. The question belongs to both readings. |
| 7 | "The one who doesn't know he's being watched." | HIM | THE CALL — Tense | Back to the face. He glances over his shoulder, presses closer to the phone. Tighter generation if we have one. |
| 8 | "Do we still have any of those?" | VOICE | TRANSIT C — Losing Him | The surveillance frame, but it's late. He's at the edge, almost out of shot. The system is losing track. The voice is almost warm. The architecture is cold and slightly wrong. |

### THE TELL (20–30s)
Longer holds. We stay with the face. The cage is failing.

| # | Line | Who | Shot | Notes |
|---|------|-----|------|-------|
| 9 | "No. That's the problem." | HIM | THE CALL — Shifting | His body has changed. The swallowed laugh. Free hand visible, gesturing. Use a generation where the face flickers toward warmth. |
| 10 | "Uh, okay. We can have you try but how do we validate?" | VOICE | THE CALL — Shifting | Stay on him. The voice stumbles. The image doesn't react. The world doesn't know what just happened. |
| 11 | "We don't. We just see if it holds." | HIM | THE CALL — Shifting | Hold. He's making a decision out loud. Longest single shot in the piece. |
| 12 | "Let's find out. Ready?" | VOICE | TRANSIT D — Walking Toward | He's moving toward the camera now. Not away. The corridor frames him centrally. The geometry that was containing him is now presenting him. |
| 13 | "Go ahead." | HIM | THE BREAK | Eyes to camera. The almost-smile. Hold for one full beat of silence — let the audience sit in the discomfort of being seen. Then the image destabilizes. Artifacts consume the frame. Black. |

## VEO GENERATION STRATEGY

### Approach
Generate pools of material for each texture, not individual shots. We're cutting from the best of many generations, not sequencing a storyboard.

- TRANSIT shots: Generate 4-6 variations per type. Look for interesting artifacts in the architecture. Shots where the geometry feels oppressive. Shots where it feels like it's losing coherence.
- CALL shots: Generate 8-10 variations. This is where we live. We need range — tense, guarded, softening, gesturing. Veo's instability in faces is a feature here.
- BREAK shot: Generate several. We need one moment where the eyes find the camera. If Veo gives us a generation where the face starts to smile and then the image falls apart, that's the ending.

### Key Veo prompt note
Add "Static camera angle unchanged from before" to video prompts for shots that need consistent framing (especially THE CALL series). Use reference images from Nano Banana as input frames.

### Artifact philosophy
Every visual glitch reinforces the paranoid reading even as the words tell a different story. Signal interference. State distortion. A world that doesn't want you to see what's really happening. Do not clean up artifacts. Select for them.

## EDITING NOTES

- VO-first. Record/generate all dialogue, cut the audio rhythm, then lay visuals to match.
- Cuts tighten through Contact, loosen through the Tell. The rhythm mirrors the shift from commands to conversation.
- The transit shots should feel progressively less competent as surveillance. A → locked on target. B → observing through glass. C → catching him too late. D → he's facing you and you didn't choose this.
- The final beat of silence before artifacts is essential. One second of being seen, then dissolution.
- Total cuts: ~12-13 across 25-30 seconds.

## TITLE CARDS

- No intro. Cold open. "I'm here." We're already inside it.
- Outro: **a][ productions** — white on black, two seconds, gone. No explanation, no title card, no "made with AI."
- Post title / metadata: "Proceed." — Description can reference AIphaville (2026) for the film nerds.
